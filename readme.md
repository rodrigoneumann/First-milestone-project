# STEVEN TYLER WEBSITE
First Millestone Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute 

This is a model for a Steven Tyler website. Steven Tyler is a musician known worldwide for his success with his band Aerosmith.
My idea with this project is to show Steven Tyler in his solo career. I added the singer's main audio media channels, concert videos in solo shows or in partnerships with other musicians and a photo shoot. To conclude I added a sector with social media and a form for an email list for news about the singer.
This site was thought of those who are fans of Steven Tyler and his work in his solo carrer. 
**This site was made for study purposes, so it will not be used in any way for any other purposes. Preserving all the copyrights of the visual materials used in this project.**


## Demo
A live demo can be found [here](https://rodrigoneumann.github.io/First-milestone-project/).


## UX
*This site was thought to have a clean and minimalist design, valuing much more the artistic and visual side.
*The color scheme was chosen to create a sleek and modern feel. 


## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.3.1)
4. OWL Carousel (2.3.4) - Videos section for a better videos organization and view
5. Fancybox - Gallery modal pop-up to a better images view
6. Jquery - For the OWL Carousel funcionalities
7. Youtube embed video JS - To play the youtube videos embed
8. Javascript - Sidebar
9. Autoprefixer CSS - Autoprefixer is a PostCSS plugin which parse the CSS and add vendor prefixes


## Features
*This project was developed in Mobile first design with fully responsiveness.
*This site uses a side bar menu with delayed scrool effect, When it's a mobile display is show 100% of width, in a medium and big screens that opens only 250px on the left side. After click the menu closes with delay effect as well.
*This site uses the Owl Carousel model CSS with his Javascript function added to show the videos in a carousel style.
*All the music player icons get the original color when hover state. Ive used the grayscale like default for all of them.
*The photos sector uses a gallery modal in CSS and Fancybox JS to open and maximise the photo for a better visualization.
*It's possible to show the next or previous photo without close that box as well.   
*There is a formular on the Follow section for a subscription to receive news about Steven Tyler (not implemented). Only a pop-out with submit confirmation.
*The Social media icons change color with a transition ease-in-out when hover state.

## Testing
*This site was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Opera, Safari, Firefox and IE) on https://www.browserling.com (Operational System and version brownser live simulator) and on multiple mobile devices (emulated by development tools by Google Chrome) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.
*IE 11 is not fully suported. most recent versions of the other tested browsers worked properly.


## Deployment
*This project was developed using Visual Studio Code and Github to push, hosting and version control.
*This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch.
*All images was edited by me using Photoshop CC 2019 and compressed by https://tinyjpg.com/

*The social media links model was taken by Full stack Diploma "ROSIE CV" Classes with some modifications.
*The gallery modal was inspired by a colleague in Code institute - Anna Gilhespy website. https://ajgreaves.github.io/portrait-artist/gallery.html with my modifications.


### Acknowledgements
*The sidebar model used was found and learned through this tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOOtDmh-NZw)

*The carousel on videos section was inspired by [example](https://www.ivetesangalo.com/#videos . ps. When I used this model, the website was in a older model, now it was changed for a new version, but I think it looks like the same visualization.
The best solution to do something like that was OWL carousel.

*I have used the https://code-institute-solutions.github.io/StudentExampleProjectGradeFive/ website like a real-life model for the bootstrap grids use. 

*I have used a lot the bootstrap oficial documentation in this project development. 

**This is for educational use.**
